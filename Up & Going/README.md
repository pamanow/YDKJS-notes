1) JS falsy values: `'', 0, -0, NaN, null, undefined, false`
2) type of null === 'object' - long standing bug in JS
3) build in types: `string, number, boolean, null, undefined, object, symbol`
4) Coercion - TBD
5) The NaN value would make x !== x be true. There is only value in JS which is not equal to itself
